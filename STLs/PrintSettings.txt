**NOTE** If you are unsure which derailleur hanger to print, and the bike has a common Shimano (Tourney, Altus, Acera, Alivio, some Deore) derailleur/drivetrain, try using the genertic hanger, it will likely work.

Same as the information found in the readme, but please make sure you follow these settings for the best results.
Recommended print settings:
Material: PETG is okay, ABS/ASA highly recommended
Perimeters/walls: 4
Infill: 100%
Top/bottom layers: 3
Print speed: no greater than 200mm/s
