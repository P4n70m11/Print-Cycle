# PrintCycle
An open-source repository of 3D-printable bike components designed for nonprofit bike shops to freely access and use.

All files are under the STLs folder and are ready to be printed. Most are exported y-axis up, but reorient them as you see fit.
Recommended print settings:
**Material**: PETG is okay, ABS/ASA highly recommended
**Perimeters/walls**: 4
**Infill**: 100%
**Top/bottom layers**: 3
**Print speed**: no greater than 200mm/s

Current parts include derailleur hangars for multiple bikes, 3D printable tire levers.

Process for strengthening using epoxy/super glue coming soon.
